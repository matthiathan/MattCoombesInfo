        <div class="Sum2-text">Need for Speed Heat is a racing game set in Palm City, a fictitious version of Miami, Florida, 
            and its surrounding environments. The in-game map has a varied topography, including open spaces and hilly regions. 
            Players can flip between day and night, however unlike Need for Speed Payback, the game does not feature a 24-hour 
            day-and-night cycle. Players can participate in legal race events throughout the day to earn money to buy new cars 
            and other enhancements. Players can also participate in illegal street racing during the night, which awards REP. A rogue 
            police task team that patrols Palm City's streets, that is tasked with shutting down racing, will be alerted by nighttime racing.</div>

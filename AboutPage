            and take place on roads. The first racer to cross the finish line after completing all laps or reaching the end point of 
            a sprint first is the winner. <br><br>

            Every route has multiple checkpoints that racers must pass through in order and they all have a recommended road-grip handling 
            profile.<br><br>

            An event can take place during the day or at night: <br><br>

                    PERFORMANCE CUSTOMIZATION <br>
                    weak your car’s performance to match your driving preference, whatever your style. There are four main areas you can customize:
                    Engine, Chassis, Drivetrain, and Auxiliary. Upgrading the Engine will give you more power to play with. But if you’re all about
                    how your ride handles you’ll want to focus on the Chassis. Drivetrain gives you access to a combination of handling parts and
                    pure performance parts. And Auxiliary covers everything from nitrous to repair kits.
                </li>

                <li>
                    VISUAL CUSTOMIZATION <br>
                    If you can dream it, you can design it in Need for Speed Heat. You’ve got a massive assortment of paint and finish options to
                     choose from, not to mention the hottest splitters, bumpers, tires, grilles, spoilers, and morel. Wild customs? Go faster 
                     stripes? It’s all you. Looking for even more options? The wrap editor is back and better than ever, with new decals, 
                     collectibles, and cop logos!

                    Character Customization <br>
                    For the first time in Need for Speed history customization doesn’t begin and end on four wheels. Now you can customize 
                    your character to fit your mood, your style, or to match the look and feel of your ride.
